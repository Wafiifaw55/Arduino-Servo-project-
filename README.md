# Arduino-Servo-project-
this project we use arduino Uno board and MG995 Servo motor.
there is two arduino code file the first fils is for control 5servo motor by rotation it poth direction (CW)&(CCW) 90 degree automatically, there is schematic, code file included tinkercad project link.
the other project is same but we control the 5servo by arduino Uno and  5potentiometer, we can turn the servo 180 degree poth direction, ther is schematic and code file.
